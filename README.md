# Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Machine Learning For the Cybersecurity Professional
## Resources for the Cybersecurity Professional
I hope to mostly focus here on a few items that are to help cybersecurity professionals in their day to day lives.

I have broken this down into the following sections, with a list of Articles, News and Research at the bottom that generally make my "good for cybersecurity folks to know" list. If you see something you'd like to see added to the list below or any of these categories, please reach out to me via a comment or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cybershujin/).

*New* Fresh from passing my GIAC Machine Learning Engineer (GMLE) exam, I put together a supplemental learning guide for anyone interested in the GMLE. Whether you are considering taking the SANs SEC595 course and want to know what you prerequisite knowledge is really needed, curious about the ground this course covers, or you're currently enrolled in the course and need some suggestions on additional resources for deeper understanding this resource is for you.
