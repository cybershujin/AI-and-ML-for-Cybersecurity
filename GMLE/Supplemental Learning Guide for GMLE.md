As a recent graduate of the GIAC Machine Learning Engineer (GMLE) certification program, I've been frequently asked about my experience and recommendations for those considering or currently pursuing this new course (SEC595). In this article, I'll share my insights and a curated list of supplemental resources that I found invaluable during my studies.

### My Learning Approach

I believe in reinforcing concepts through diverse explanations and examples. While the SANS [SEC 595 course](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/applied-data-science-machine-learning/) material is comprehensive, I sought additional resources to deepen my understanding. This approach may be more than necessary for some, but for those who desire a broader perspective or struggle with certain concepts, these supplemental materials can be incredibly helpful. 

Before diving into specific resources, I highly recommend exploring the work of **Andrew Ng.** His explanations of machine learning, deep learning, and AI concepts are exceptional and complement the SANS course material well. You can find his content on platforms like [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/).

### Pre-requisite recommendations

Originally this course description specifically stated you did not need to know much Python or mathematics prior to taking the course. However, it appears they have now updated it (probably based on some passionate feedback) to say "Intermediate Python fluency is important. Pre-calculus mathematics skills are important, but not required." I included Python resources below that cover from absolute beginner to intermediate learners.

That said, the course still claims that they will show you math but not expect you to do it. That is not strictly true. You will still need to be able to perform things like calculations of mean, median, mode and standard deviations on datasets using Python. Hypothetically, you could argue *you* are not required to do the math because Python performs the calculations, but you do need to understand the math. If I said "Find the most common grade for these three tests" you should be able to say you're looking for the mode. I recommend when making your index that you create a separate [index](https://tisiphone.net/2015/08/18/giac-testing/) of just the mathematical equations and what page numbers they can be found on.

I would recommend the following going in:

- AI for Everyone [AI for Everyone - DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-everyone/)
- Firm intermediate python understanding:
  - If a beginner - **strongly** recommend starting with the first two levels of CodeCombat.com combined with codecademy
  - If intermediate, or after doing Codecombat.com: [Codecademy: Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/) 
- Basic understanding of math concepts and python using statistics
  - [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization (deeplearning.ai)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-specialization/)
  - [Codecademy: Statistics - Mean, Median and Mode](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/statistics-mean-median-mode-course) 
  - [Codecademy: Learn Statistics with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-statistics-with-python)
  - [Codecademy: Fundamental Math for Data Science](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/fundamental-math-for-data-science)

Especially if you are doing the in-person 5 day course instead of the online learning, this will help you keep up with the fast pace of the class. There is a lot more time spent in the workbook of this class, doing labs in Juypter Lab than many other SANs courses.

### Conclusion

While these resources greatly enhanced my learning experience, it's important to note that the SANS course material alone is sufficient for most students to pass the GMLE certification. These supplemental materials are for those who, like me, benefit from multiple perspectives or seek a deeper understanding of the concepts.

Remember, the key to success in this course is consistent practice and hands-on application of the concepts. Don't just passively consume the material â€“ engage with it, experiment, and most importantly, enjoy the learning process!

Good luck on your #GMLE #SEC595 journey!
